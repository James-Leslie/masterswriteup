This chapter details the tuning and evaluation of the CGT model. Prediction of genres using the CGT approach is sequential transfer learning task, therefore the rating and genre model need to be trained in sequence.

First, the hyperparameters of the rating model were tuned using 5-fold cross validation. In each fold, 80\% of the ratings were used to train the model and the remaining 20\% was used for validation. The best combination of hyperparameters was chosen using a Cartesian grid search, in which every possible combination hyper parameters was trained and validated on each of the 5 folds.
